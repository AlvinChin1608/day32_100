Dear Future Alvin,

It’s me, Alvin from the past. I’m currently immersed in my Python bootcamp, mastering SMTP, and using it to send you this reminder that today is [NAME] birthday. I've recently moved from the UK to Malaysia and am taking this time to focus on self-improvement while looking for new professional opportunities in Southeast Asia.

To ensure you continue receiving these reminders, I’ve set up the code to run in the cloud using PythonAnywhere. This way, you'll always be notified of important dates.

I hope this message finds you well. What challenges have you overcome recently? Remember to thank God for every twist and turn in your journey. Even when the path is uncertain, His guidance is always there.

Treat yourself with kindness and recognise your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. Keep striving for excellence—you’re making amazing progress!

Best wishes,
Past Alvin
